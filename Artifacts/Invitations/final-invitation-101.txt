GOOOOD MORNING VIETNAM!!!!!
The time is 01:01, 2024/12/14, and it's time to GET YOUR ARSES OUT OF THAT JAIL CELL!
– Just Kidding!

Hi everyone :)

Apologies for that odd burst of creativity—I didn’t mean to startle you… well, not too much! ;)

Now, with that out of the way, let’s get to the proper introduction. I, Trenton, have been working on a fascinating (and slightly chaotic) work of art, and you’re all invited to collaborate on it in your own unique ways! The goal? To collect and connect a bunch of diverse ideas and viewpoints, creating a collaborative map of how we relate to one another in simple and profound ways (often both at the same time!).

Here’s the gist: my journey began with a book, The Human Promise: Follow the Unnamed Feeling. Spoiler alert: as a software engineer by study and trade, my kind of book is a bit more technically advanced than your average novella. Hahaha! Over time, it’s evolved into something so abstract and hard to describe that I’ve recruited you—my top advisors—to help me name the unnamable.

So, read on, Brave Reader, if you wish to hear a story…

The Unnamed Feeling – Infinite Playground Boot Camp
1. Mission Objective
Life’s messy, full of paradoxes and distractions. Your mission is simple: unlock "The Unnamed Feeling," your inner compass for authentic living. Master it, trust it, and let it guide you through the chaos.

2. Training Plan
This isn’t just theory—it’s action.

Learn it: Define the Unnamed Feeling.
Train it: Sharpen awareness with focused exercises.
Live it: Apply what you’ve learned in real-world challenges.
Rinse, repeat, and reflect: Progress happens one mission at a time.
3. Command and Control
You’re the captain of this ship, but guidance is here if you need it.

Resources? Delivered.
Questions? Ask away.
Updates? You’ll get them.
Now, saddle up and trust your instincts.

Closing Orders
Life’s not a drill, but it is a playground. So, get out there, play hard, and follow that Unnamed Feeling like your life depends on it—because, spoiler alert, it kinda does.

Let’s roll.
