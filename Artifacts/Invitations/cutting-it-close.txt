Hi everyone :)
Apologies for that odd display of creativity, I didn't mean to startle you - well, at least not too much! ;)
Well then, with that out of the way, let's get on to the proper introduction, eh? I - (Trenton, that is), have been working on this very interesting and not quite solid work of art that you are each invited to collaborate on, in your own unique ways! The idea is that, by collecting and connecting a bunch of disparateÂ ideas and viewpoints, we can create a sort of collaborative map of how each of us relates to one another in both simple and profound ways (oftentimes, both!).
Anyway, please see below for a brief outline of the structure of this project and how you can start your journey - or rather, continue it, but differently! - with this work as a companion.
My own journey started with a book, The Human Promise: Follow the Unnamed Feeling. Spoiler alert - I'm a software engineer by study and day job. So my kind of book is a little technically advanced compared to your everyday novella hahahah! This book evolved and shaped up into something that I now even have so much trouble describing simply that I am recruiting some of my top advisors (that is you!) for assistance in naming the unnamable.
So, read on, Brave Reader! If you wish to hear a story.
Best and Love,Trenton

Hi everyone :)

Apologies for that odd burst of creativityâ€”I didnâ€™t mean to startle youâ€¦ well, not too much! ;)

Now, with that out of the way, letâ€™s get to the proper introduction. I, Trenton, have been working on a fascinating (and slightly chaotic) work of art, and youâ€™re all invited to collaborate on it in your own unique ways! The goal? To collect and connect a bunch of diverse ideas and viewpoints, creating a collaborative map of how we relate to one another in simple and profound ways (often both at the same time!).

Hereâ€™s the gist: my journey began with a book, The Human Promise: Follow the Unnamed Feeling. Spoiler alert: as a software engineer by study and trade, my kind of book is a bit more technically advanced than your average novella. Hahaha! Over time, itâ€™s evolved into something so abstract and hard to describe that Iâ€™ve recruited youâ€”my top advisorsâ€”to help me name the unnamable.

So, read on, Brave Reader, if you wish to hear a storyâ€¦
