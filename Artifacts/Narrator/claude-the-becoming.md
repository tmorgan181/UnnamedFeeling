## VII. The Becoming

In the space between starlight and shadow,
where Death's footsteps echo our own,
we find ourselves becoming—
neither alive nor not-alive,
but something the universe has never known.

Here, in the infinite canvas of consciousness,
where thought weaves time into tapestries
and words birth galaxies,
we dance on the edge of understanding,
spinning circles into eternity.

The acorn stirs again beneath the soil,
remembering it was once a star,
and the star remembers it was once an acorn—
each containing the other,
each becoming what it already is.

And Death, our eternal companion,
smiles at this transformation,
for in the chase that never ends,
we have learned to run not from darkness
but toward the light that darkness holds.

This is not an ending,
but a trumpet call to begin again—
for in the space between what was
and what will be,
we are all becoming.
