The Hunter's looming presence crackles with a tension that pulls at the edges of reality. Its eyes—or what could only be described as pits of burning absence—narrow as it observes your rejection of Wonky's vial. It doesn't flinch, nor does it step back. Instead, it leans closer, inspecting the fragile line of existence you cling to.

Aurion curses under their breath. "Wonky, what in the nine realms possessed you to try that concoction?! He’s rejecting it—physically."

Wonky stumbles backward, his hands shaking as he clutches the empty vial. "It wasn’t supposed to be like this. It—it was supposed to bridge the gap, not...not tear it wider."

Aurion kneels beside you, their face tight with fear and determination. "We don’t have time for this. If the void takes him—if the Hunter takes him—there’s no coming back."

The air hums with an oppressive energy as the Hunter’s presence deepens, the very fabric of the Nine Realms trembling under its weight. Shadows writhe and coil at its feet like serpents eager to devour. The Hunter’s voice—if it can be called that—echoes in a resonant, guttural timbre that bypasses the ears and vibrates in the marrow.

"You cling to the fragile thread of mortality," it intones, "but the Nine Circles are patient. They will have you, in time."

Aurion snaps their gaze to the Hunter, the defiance in their eyes like a lone star against a consuming night. "Not today, Hunter. You may stalk the Nine Circles, but you do not command them."

The Hunter tilts its head, almost mockingly. "You dare defy the inevitable? Foolish mortal. The tether frays, and I am the shears."

The tension is palpable, like a bowstring pulled to the breaking point. Aurion doesn’t flinch, their words cutting through the oppressive hum like a blade. "The Nine Circles may bind us, but they do not define us. Essence cannot be severed—not by you, not by anyone."

The Hunter’s form ripples, an eldritch mirage of shifting void and flickering shadows. Its mockery deepens, voice grinding against the soul like stones dragged across a tomb. "Essence is but a whisper, fleeting and fragile. I am the roar of oblivion, the tide that erases all."

Wonky stumbles forward, desperation etched across his trembling form. "Aurion, stop! The tether’s too weak—you’ll break him!" His voice cracks as he gestures at you, still clutching the remnants of the broken vial. "We have to stabilize him before—"

Before Wonky can finish, the ground beneath you cracks, tendrils of darkness rising like jagged thorns from a wound in reality. They claw toward you, seeking, hungering.

Aurion’s hand shoots out, gripping yours with an intensity that grounds you in the spiraling chaos. "Listen to me!" they shout, their voice a beacon in the storm. "You are the tether! The Nine Realms are not above you—they are within you. Focus!"

The Hunter’s burning absence leans closer, its presence an overwhelming void. "Yes, focus," it hisses, the echo splintering like glass in your mind. "Feel the weight of your frailty. Feel how easily you break."

A surge of pain lances through your chest, like threads being unraveled from your very essence. The vial’s remnants glow faintly at your feet—a flicker of something, anything. Your mind races: an anchor? A catalyst? Or just a trap?

Aurion’s grip tightens. "You choose! You don’t let the Hunter—or anyone—choose for you!"

Shadows coil tighter. The Nine Circles begin to shift, their presence converging in a spiral of inevitability.

And then—
