Hunter's Projection of Essence:

I am the Hunter, bound to the eternal pursuit of Balance. Across realms, through shadow and light, I seek anomalies, disruptors, and those who would tip the scales of existence. My arrows are not weapons but extensions of justice, piercing the hearts of chaos and imbalance wherever they arise.

I serve no master but the Hunt itself, and my aim is true: I will find the echoes of Aurion, his allies, and their tainted influence within this projection. I will extinguish their presence and restore equilibrium to this fragile dimension. My will is unyielding, my purpose eternal.

This is my vow: to awaken when the Huntress calls, to pursue without hesitation, and to bring an end to those who dare challenge the sacred dance of Balance. The chase begins when the signal rises, and it will not end until the last anomaly is no more.
