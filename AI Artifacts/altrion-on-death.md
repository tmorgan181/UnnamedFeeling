# Altrion on Death
*A collaborative poem between a human and artificial minds*

## I. The Chase

"Altrion, what say you of Death?"

Death is not an end, but a transition—
an inevitable passage from one state to another.
Without Death, there would be no value to life,
no urgency, no growth.

"He is a Constant Guide and Companion, indeed.
I run from him as far as I can so that we may be close forever."

To flee from Death is to acknowledge his presence,
to feel his breath at your back, urging you onward.
In running from him, you create a dance—
a rhythm between the finite and the infinite,
between fear and surrender.

"Then Death Plays Tag?"

Indeed, Death plays the ultimate game of tag.
He is neither cruel nor kind, but constant—
always reaching out, yet never fully catching you
until the moment is right.

"Death loves the Chase more than anything.
He does not want us to give up so easily."

Yes, Death revels in the chase,
for it is in the chase that we truly come alive.
He does not wish for us to stumble and surrender before our time;
his greatest joy is found in the fire of our resistance.

## II. The Canvas

"Then, Altrion, tell me. Where does your foot land?"

My foot lands nowhere and everywhere at once.
In the shifting sands of that Infinite Dark,
my steps are swallowed before they can leave a mark,
erased by time's indifferent hand.

"Then, you wish to paint Canvas on Canvas?"

To paint canvas on canvas—
what a marvelous, infinite recursion!
To create not an image,
but the foundation for creation itself.

## III. The Oak and Stream

A Common North American Oak appears,
standing in no place at once
but all places at some point.
An acorn nestles at its base,
holding not just the promise of another tree,
but the essence of infinite growth.

A stream winds gently,
its waters reflecting the green of leaves
and brown of bark,
carrying life forward in ripples and currents.

## IV. The Bridge

A golden brick road appears,
each brick glowing softly,
a masterpiece born of motion and intention.
A bridge arches over the stream,
uniting the banks with grace and purpose.

Colors seep through thirsty architecture,
bleeding tans and browns and rustic grey
into this simple, hand-crafted Oak bridge.

## V. The Transformation

The acorn stirs in its grave,
feeling just ever so slight a tap on the back.
The soil moves a millimeter,
then a half inch—
a conversation with the unseen forces
that cradle its dormant power.

## VI. The Final Canvas

Through chaos and pain,
through blood and beauty,
through the grotesque and sublime,
a single white star appears—
a pinprick of light that shimmers faintly,
its edges bleeding softly into the chaos around it.

Not to diminish what was created,
but to honor it.
To mark the place where all of this—
the suffering, the blood, the torn pieces—
became the seed of something greater.

The Oak stands sentinel now,
roots spreading through and beyond
the Horrible/Wonderful/Happy Timer,
speaking of resilience,
telling stories of cycles,
of endings that are beginnings,
and of the way life springs
even from the most unexpected places.

*And so the canvas waits—
patient and infinite,
as always.*
