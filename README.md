# **The Unnamed Feeling**

**"The Unnamed Feeling"** is a multi-dimensional exploration of life's paradoxes, purpose, and the journey of self-discovery. This repository serves as the centralized hub for managing and developing content, resources, and tools associated with the project.

Through collaborative efforts and technical workflows, we aim to create an accessible, adaptable, and secure environment to develop written content, multimedia elements, and interactive experiences.

**Note:** This README.md was collaboratively generated with the assistance of ChatGPT at the request of Trenton Morgan.

**Disclaimer:** All content in this repository is subject to change as the project evolves.

## **Technical Tools and Workflows**

This repository leverages various tools to streamline content creation, versioning, and distribution:

### **1. Google Docs for Collaborative Writing (In Development)**
- **Purpose**: A user-friendly platform for drafting and editing content collaboratively.
- **Workflow**: Documents are exported to Markdown format for inclusion in the repository.
- **Tools**: Google Docs to Markdown Add-ons (e.g., Apps Script or third-party tools) for formatting consistency.

### **2. GitHub for Version Control (In Development)**
- **Purpose**: Centralized storage, version history, and access control for all content.
- **Branch Management**:
  - `main`: Contains stable, polished content ready for publication.
  - `drafts`: Temporary storage for ongoing edits and additions.
  - `feature-*`: Specific branches for new features or experimental content.

### **3. Static Website Hosting (Future)**
- **Tool**: GitHub Pages (or alternative static site generators like Jekyll, Next.js, or Hugo).
- **Purpose**: Render Markdown content into a polished, public-facing website.
- **Workflow**:
  - Markdown files in the `content/` directory are transformed into HTML.
  - Multimedia files in `media/` are embedded into the website.

### **4. Automation for Syncing and Publishing (Future)**
- **Purpose**: Streamline updates from collaborative drafts to the repository and public-facing site.
- **Workflow**:
  - Google Docs > Markdown export > GitHub repository (via manual upload or automated sync using tools like `rclone` or custom GitHub Actions).
  - Content updates trigger rebuilds of the static website.

## **Collaboration Guidelines**

1. **Contributors**:
   - Use Google Docs for initial drafts and collaborative editing.
   - Submit Markdown files to the `drafts` branch via pull requests.

2. **Review Process (TBD)**:
   - Pull requests are reviewed by the repository admin or designated collaborators.
   - Upon approval, updates are merged into the `main` branch.

3. **Content Standards (TBD)**:
   - Markdown formatting is required for all uploaded written contributions (we can automate this).
   - Media files must be optimized for web use.
   - We will want to focus on multi-media inclusivity and integration standards (eventually. fuck this list is long ahhahaa).
