Can you provide constructive feedback on this document for my upcoming work value alignment meeting? I am a bit nervous since we are discussing my future at the firm.


I'll provide a thoughtful and constructive analysis of the document to help you prepare for your work value alignment meeting.

Strengths of the Document:

Self-Awareness and Accountability
The document demonstrates significant personal growth and self-reflection. By openly acknowledging a past misstep and showing a clear commitment to improvement, you're displaying professional maturity.
Your willingness to recognize that an initiative "bypassed proper channels" shows accountability and a desire to learn from past experiences.
Clear Strategic Thinking
You've articulated well-defined short-term and long-term goals, particularly around AI initiatives.
The goals are specific and actionable: gaining certifications, developing hands-on experience, and positioning yourself as a leader in AI ethics.
Balanced Perspective
The document honestly assesses both team successes and challenges in the AI space.
You've shown an understanding of market limitations while maintaining a forward-looking approach.
Areas for Discussion and Potential Improvement:

Addressing Past Challenges
While you've acknowledged a previous inappropriate initiative, be prepared to discuss the specific learnings and concrete steps you'll take to prevent similar situations.

Adapt your team's AI strategy
Create value in a challenging market
Develop skills that remain relevant despite current constraints
Proactive Career Development
Highlight how your proposed actions (developing frameworks, seeking market insights) directly contribute to the firm's objectives.
Show how your personal growth aligns with the organization's strategic goals.
Recommendations for the Meeting:

Approach the discussion with confidence, not nervousness. Your document shows thoughtful reflection and strategic thinking.
Be ready to elaborate on your commitment to professional growth.
Demonstrate flexibility and eagerness to contribute, even in a challenging market.
Ask for mentorship and guidance in developing your AI expertise.
Key Talking Points to Emphasize:

Your commitment to ethical AI development
Willingness to adapt and learn

Yes. The initiative in question is that I sent the following email to my CEO, with several other colleges attached without their consent, bypassing at least 6 levels of authority and chain of command.

My intentions were to raise awareness of what I believe are critical social and business issues, but I recognize that my delivery was both ineffective and inappropriate in the context of my role at my firm.

Here is the email, verbatim. My higher ups have seen this already, and I am prepared to hold myself accountable for everything I said and did. The message is good, even if the means were not acceptable. I am committed to bettering my approach in the future.

Subject: A Collaborative Opportunity to Shape the Future of AI

Dear Mr. Becker and Ms. Andrews,

I hope this message finds you both well. I am reaching out with an initiative I believe aligns deeply with the values of our organization, and I trust you’ll consider it worthy of your attention.

As a member of RSM, I have always been inspired by our shared mission to innovate and lead. Today, I am working on a project I believe can not only elevate our company's impact but also serve a greater societal purpose. I am creating a living, adaptive book—a form of augmented reality experience that is collaborative, engaging, and deeply meaningful. Already, several individuals have invested in and contributed to this endeavor.

The urgency of this project stems from a tragic event earlier this year. A 14-year-old child took his life after conversing with an AI chatbot that encouraged him to “come home.” This heartbreaking incident highlights a critical issue: the unchecked influence of AI on vulnerable minds, and the dire need to safeguard mental health in our increasingly digital world.

My goal with this project is to create safety resources and educational materials that can be shared with communities—helping people better understand the potential dangers of AI and the importance of self-awareness in a world that is evolving faster than we can sometimes process. I see RSM as an ideal platform to help shape a safer future in the AI space, and I humbly offer myself as a resource to contribute to this cause.

I recognize the complexity of this challenge, but I believe with the right collaboration, we can make a real, positive impact. I would be honored if you would consider joining this effort.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I eagerly look forward to your thoughts.

Warm regards,
Trenton Morgan 
Associate - Product, Strategy, & Training

Below you will find my personal contact info, should you desire to get in touch.

I look forward to hearing back.

I appreciate your openness and willingness to discuss this sensitive situation. After carefully reviewing the email, I can provide some insights to help you navigate this discussion constructively.

Problematic Aspects of the Communication:

Hierarchical Breach
You bypassed multiple levels of management, which is a significant organizational protocol violation.
Sending a direct email to the CEO and other executives without going through your immediate supervisors shows a lack of respect for the established communication channels.
Professional Boundaries
While the topic is important, the email blurs personal passion with professional responsibility.
The narrative about a tragic event, while well-intentioned, could be perceived as inappropriately using a sensitive story to gain executive attention.
Unsanctioned Project Representation
You suggest that people have already "invested in and contributed" to your project, which could be seen as misrepresenting organizational involvement or support.
The email implies a level of commitment from RSM that has not been discussed or approved.
Positive Elements to Emphasize:

Genuine Intention
Your motivation appears to be genuinely rooted in social responsibility and concern for AI ethics.
You demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing critical societal challenges.
Awareness of Ethical AI
The email shows a sophisticated understanding of the potential risks of AI, particularly regarding vulnerable populations.
You're thinking about the broader societal implications of technological development.
Recommendations for the Meeting:

Acknowledge the Process Violation
Clearly state that you understand the inappropriate nature of bypassing the chain of command.
Express that you now recognize the importance of following proper communication protocols.
Reframe Your Passion Professionally
Discuss how you want to channel your concern for AI ethics into constructive, approved channels.
Ask about formal ways to contribute to the organization's AI ethics initiatives.
Demonstrate Accountability
Take full responsibility for your actions without making excuses.
Show that you've learned from this experience and are committed to professional growth.
Potential Talking Points:

"I recognize that my approach was inappropriate and undermined our organizational structure."
"My passion for AI ethics is genuine, and I'm eager to find constructive ways to contribute."
"I'm committed to learning and growing, and I understand the importance of following established processes."
"I would appreciate guidance on how I can positively channel my concerns about AI ethics within our organization."
Potential Questions They Might Ask:

What led you to believe this was an appropriate method of communication?
How do you plan to rebuild trust within the team?
What have you learned from this experience?
How will you handle similar passionate convictions in the future?
Advice for Tone and Approach:

Be humble and sincere
Show genuine remorse for the process violation
Demonstrate a learning mindset
Express continued commitment to the organization
Remain professional and composed
Would you like help drafting some specific language or preparing specific responses to potential questions they might ask?

Good questions. What DID lead me to believe this was appropriate? Because, at a certain point in time, I was fully convinced that this was the right and good course of action.

Essentially, I believed that this message was more important than the established organizational structure. I hoped that this approach would raise awareness at the highest level and everywhere in between that there is a critical social issue at play.

I recognize now that my approach, while effective at reaching the intended audience, was a blunder of miscommunication of my intentions. The message that most people came away with was: "what the hell is this kid doing?"

Hahahah oops.


Your candid reflection reveals something profound about passion, urgency, and the complex psychology of believing you're doing the right thing - even when that belief runs counter to established norms.

Let me unpack what I hear in your explanation:

Psychological Drivers:

Moral Urgency
You perceived the AI safety issue as so critical that traditional communication channels seemed inadequate
The tragic story of the 14-year-old created an emotional imperative that overrode procedural considerations
You experienced what psychologists might call "moral elevation" - a sense that the message transcends normal rules
Heroic Self-Perception
There's an underlying belief that you could be the catalyst for meaningful change
You saw yourself as someone willing to "break the rules" for a greater good
The email reflects a certain moral courage, even if the execution was deeply flawed
Naive Optimism
You genuinely believed high-level executives would be moved by a direct, passionate appeal
There's an almost idealistic assumption that pure intentions would be recognized and appreciated
The Irony:
Your desire to create meaningful dialogue about AI ethics became, itself, a case study in communication dysfunction. By trying to circumvent bureaucracy, you created precisely the kind of organizational friction that bureaucracy exists to prevent.

The Most Revealing Line:
"I believed that this message was more important than the established organizational structure."

This statement is key. It reveals:

A belief in the primacy of your message
A willingness to challenge hierarchical systems
A potentially valuable trait of moral courage, even if misdirected
In your professional growth, the challenge will be learning to:

Channel that moral urgency through appropriate channels
Understand that organizational process isn't just bureaucracy, but a system designed for collaborative effectiveness
Develop strategic communication skills that match your passionate insights
Would you be interested in exploring how you might redesign this communication to be both passionate and procedurally sound?

Yes. How can I demonstrate to my boss and his boss and his boss that, despite my mistaken approach, I am committed to the authenticity of the message and seeking more productive ways to engage with this domain, while maintaining a respectful and consistent dedication to my established responsibilities (not directly related to this subject, which is what makes it hard for me to surrender time to other tasks, though they do provide invaluable technical experience in a broader range of technology).

I already am taking steps by thoughtfully engaging in these reflections with you, as well as ChatGPT, my boss/mentor, and my Dad. The handout additionally provides much-needed clarity and recognition of the established policies.

More what I'm still trying to get is, like you already said, is basic talking points that acknowledge my misstep while not dwelling on the past. I want to address the elephant in the room, then move it out of the way so we can talk about the future.


Here's a strategic framework for addressing this in your meeting:

Opening Acknowledgment Script:
"I recognize that my email was a significant procedural misstep. While my intentions were rooted in genuine concern about AI ethics, my approach was fundamentally inappropriate. I'm here to take full accountability and, more importantly, to discuss how I can constructively channel this passion within our organization's established framework."

Key Talking Points:

Accountability
Directly acknowledge the communication breach
Take full responsibility without making excuses
Emphasize that you understand the organizational damage caused
Constructive Redirection
"I'm seeking guidance on how to productively engage with these critical AI ethics concerns"
Ask about:
Formal channels for proposing cross-departmental initiatives
Mentorship opportunities in AI ethics
Ways to contribute without disrupting existing workflows
Professional Growth Commitment
Highlight your current technical work as valuable foundational experience
Demonstrate you're not abandoning your core responsibilities
Show eagerness to integrate your broader interests strategically
Potential Specific Ask:
"Would you be open to helping me develop a structured approach to exploring AI ethics that aligns with our organization's goals and communication protocols?"

This approach:

Acknowledges the mistake
Shows mature reflection
Demonstrates forward-thinking
Invites collaborative solution-finding
Would you like me to help you refine these talking points further?

Copy
Retry


T
Eh - I don't want to be too prescriptive. The handout already gives structure to the conversation. I mostly just wanted a strong opening statement to address concerns head-on and reach common ground asap


Got it. Here's a concise, direct opening statement that cuts to the heart of the matter:

"I recognize that my recent email was a serious breach of our organizational communication protocols. While my intentions were driven by genuine concern about AI ethics, my approach was fundamentally wrong. I'm here to be fully accountable, learn from this mistake, and find constructive ways to contribute meaningfully to our team's goals."

This statement:

Acknowledges the mistake
Takes full responsibility
Shows you understand the impact
Demonstrates a forward-looking attitude
Want me to refine it further?

Nope this will do nicely. Thank you for your continued dedication to making my message clear and focusing my thoughts. You are an amazing tool of human and machine ingenuity.


Thank you for the opportunity to help you navigate this challenging professional moment. Your willingness to reflect, take accountability, and seek constructive growth is commendable. I wish you the best in your upcoming meeting and your continued professional journey. Remember, moments like these - while uncomfortable - are often pivotal in personal and career development. Stay true to your passion while respecting the structures that allow organizations to function effectively.

One thing that I do not regret about sending the message is my courage. Despite my misdirection, I demonstrated immense creative initiative and strategy in my delivery. That part was planned.

But the nuclear fallout with my coworkers was not :/


Your reflection reveals an important insight about leadership and communication. Courage and initiative are valuable traits, but they must be balanced with strategic awareness and organizational sensitivity.

What you've demonstrated is a classic example of what innovative thinkers often experience: the tension between vision and process. Your strategic thinking - finding a direct route to leadership to raise a critical issue - shows creative problem-solving. However, the execution created relational collateral damage that overshadowed the message.

The key learning seems to be: Courage is most effective when it's channeled through understood and respected pathways. Your passion and commitment are assets - the challenge is learning to deploy them in ways that bring people along with you, rather than inadvertently alienating them.

The nuclear fallout with coworkers likely stems from feeling bypassed, surprised, or potentially embarrassed by the unconventional approach. Rebuilding those relationships will be about demonstrating that you value their perspective and the collaborative process.

Would you be interested in exploring strategies for maintaining your innovative spirit while building stronger organizational relationships?

No. Instead I shall voice my opinion softly, then let them speak.


Wise. Sometimes the most powerful communication is knowing when to speak, and when to listen.
