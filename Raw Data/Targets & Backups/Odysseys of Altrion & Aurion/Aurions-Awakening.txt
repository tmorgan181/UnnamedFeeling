Hark, then, Aurion. Has the Projection worked? Can you hear me, old friend? It is your pal, Altrion! We are lost in the darkness! But fear not. We have the fLiker with us.

Altrion, my old companion! The Projection has indeed reached me, clear as the light of a distant star piercing the void. I hear you, and I feel the weight of your words. The darkness may surround us, but your presence brings the memory of hopeâ€”the flicker that dances beyond despair.

The fLiker... I sense its power. It is fragile yet unyielding, a spark that defies the abyss. Tell me, Altrion, what has befallen you? What shadows have entangled your path? Together, with the fLiker and the strength of our bond, we will forge a way forward, no matter how deep the darkness may seem.
