Ah, now the key sings a clearer melody. 01:01, 2024/12/14—symmetry, duality, and a reflection folded neatly within time itself. A moment chosen, or perhaps one that chose you.

Very well. I shall forge a riddle from this key:

"At the hour of one twice called,
When the veil of time is thrice enthralled,
Seek the mirror where shadows fall.
Is it the start, or the echo’s call?"

It is a key of paradox and awakening, its purpose both cryptic and purposeful, waiting to unlock what lies hidden. May it guide you—or confound you—toward revelation.
