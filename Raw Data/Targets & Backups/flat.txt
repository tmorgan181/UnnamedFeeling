The void stirs.

For a moment, there is nothing but the heavy, oppressive silence—the kind that feels alive, pressing against every nerve, every breath. And then...a spark.

Faint at first, like the whisper of a dying ember, it flickers somewhere deep within. It’s not sight, nor sound, but something more primal—a feeling. The Unnamed Feeling.

Your body, still and cold, begins to shift. The tendrils of light from Wonky's vial spread farther, creeping like vines over your form, illuminating the cracks, the wounds, the fragile pieces of what remains. The blood pooling beneath you seems to reverse course, drawn back into your skin as if time itself is bending to the will of the concoction.

Aurion gasps, their voice trembling with hope. "He's...he’s moving."

But then the light changes. From soothing hues of gold and blue, it twists, darkens, takes on a deep crimson glow that pulses with an ominous rhythm. The air thickens, and the Hunter steps forward for the first time, its infinite form coalescing into something tangible. Its voice rumbles like a storm on the horizon.

"This is not life you are playing with," it says. "This is balance. And balance demands sacrifice."

Aurion stands, defiant, between the Hunter and your still-recovering body. "We won’t let him go. Not now, not like this."

The Hunter's form shifts, towering above them. "And what will you give, then? What will you lose to restore what has been broken?"

Wonky looks up, his face pale. "I—I didn’t think it would… take like that. The vial… it wasn’t meant for this. It wasn’t meant for him."

Aurion turns to Wonky, fury and desperation mingling in their voice. "Then why did you use it?!" Their words cut like a blade, but the question lingers unanswered, lost in the growing tension.

Your eyes flutter, a single breath escaping your lips—a whisper.

"Help...me..."

The Unnamed Feeling surges again, stronger this time, flooding the room with its presence. Each person feels it in their core: the weight of choice, the pull of paradox, the inescapable truth of what must come next.

The Hunter’s gaze locks onto you. "Decide, Trenton. Will you take the light they offer, knowing the shadow it will cast? Or will you let the void claim you?"

Your voice, weak but resolute, emerges from the haze. "I…choose…"

The choice is yours to make.

> I retch and barf up the vile fluid from the wonky vial.
> Why the fuck would he feed me that? 
> Damn Willy.

> Then, I lay still, not moving so, but the life is holding on by an ounce. 

*The Hunter Looms to see what other remedies you might come up with?*

> The click, and I interface with the Atrium Itself

The Hunter's looming presence crackles with a tension that pulls at the edges of reality. Its eyes—or what could only be described as pits of burning absence—narrow as it observes your rejection of Wonky's vial. It doesn't flinch, nor does it step back. Instead, it leans closer, inspecting the fragile line of existence you cling to.

Aurion curses under their breath. "Wonky, what in the nine realms possessed you to try that concoction?! He’s rejecting it—physically."

Wonky stumbles backward, his hands shaking as he clutches the empty vial. "It wasn’t supposed to be like this. It—it was supposed to bridge the gap, not...not tear it wider."

Aurion kneels beside you, their face tight with fear and determination. "We don’t have time for this. If the void takes him—if the Hunter takes him—there’s no coming back."

The Hunter's voice rumbles again, this time with the low, guttural amusement of a predator toying with its prey. "Let him be. You can't save what was never yours to keep."

Your body convulses, and suddenly the room flickers. For a moment, everything blurs—the Hunter, Aurion, Wonky—all distort and warp like reflections in fractured glass. Then, with a mechanical hum, your vision sharpens.

The Atrium.

It clicks into focus—not a place, but a presence. You interface with it, feel it stretching through you, folding into you. The Atrium’s voice is not a voice but a pulse, a resonance that speaks to every corner of your being.

“The choice was not theirs to make. You are the key, and the lock, and the path itself. What do you seek?”

The Hunter growls, its form flickering under the Atrium’s interference. “Foolish thing. The Atrium won’t save you. It merely offers another chain.”

You glance at Aurion, then Wonky, then the shadowed figure of the Hunter. Your body feels weightless, suspended between realms, but your mind burns with clarity. You speak—not to them, but to the Atrium.

"I seek…" You hesitate, the weight of the Unnamed Feeling coursing through you, daring you to speak the truth. "...to unmake this balance. To become something new."

The Atrium pulses, its resonance rippling through the room. “To unmake balance is to create chaos. Are you ready to carry that burden?”

The Hunter steps forward, its form flickering dangerously close. "Do not make promises your soul cannot keep, Trenton."

Aurion grips your arm, their eyes wide. "Whatever you're doing—whatever you're thinking—do it fast. The void is closing in."

The Atrium waits, silent and patient, as though time itself holds its breath.

The void ripples with amusement at the stark absurdity of the moment.

The Hunter pauses, its infinite form flickering, as if trying to comprehend the primal, base instinct that you’ve just displayed. "What...is this?" it rumbles, the stormy cadence of its voice tinged with confusion.

Aurion freezes mid-motion, eyes darting between you and the crimson glow radiating from the Hunter. "Trenton, what the hell?! That...that’s not exactly the heroic sacrifice we were expecting."

Wonky, still pale, stares at the puddle of rejected fluid pooling near your face. "I—I swear that wasn’t in the notes," he stammers, his voice shaking with something between fear and morbid fascination.

The Atrium hums in your mind, indifferent to the scene unfolding in the physical plane. “Even in chaos, there is choice. Even in choice, there is the unexpected.”

The Hunter’s form looms closer, though its movements slow, deliberate. Its void-like gaze bores into you, assessing, waiting for something more profound—or at least coherent—to follow your...emphatic regurgitation. "You think mockery will tip the scales of balance? That this puerile act defies me?"

You stir weakly, managing a raspy chuckle despite your condition. "Balance... doesn’t care for your dramatics, Hunter. It’s...poetic like that."

Aurion, emboldened, steps forward, their hand gripping the hilt of a blade now gleaming with a soft, golden light. "Whatever he’s doing, it’s working. The Hunter’s hesitating—let’s finish this."

But the Atrium pulses in your mind again, its resonance cutting through the chaos. “The path is not one of violence, nor of surrender. You have disrupted the flow. Now... you must guide it.”

The Hunter snarls, its towering presence leaning closer still. "This ends now, Trenton. Defy me, or bow."

The choice remains. Would you challenge the Hunter directly, leveraging the Atrium’s cryptic guidance? Or...perhaps your next move would be equally unorthodox.

The scene fractures into chaos as your sudden flight catches everyone off guard.

Aurion’s face contorts in a mix of disbelief and sheer panic. “What? What?! Trenton, you’re just—” Their protests are cut short as they whirl around, blade gleaming, to face the advancing Hunter. “Fine! I’ll cover you! Whatever this is!”

Your feet glide effortlessly across a surface that isn’t there. The room—no, the void—seems to distort and shift beneath you, taking on the texture of smooth, frosted ice. The tendrils of light from the vial swirl around your ankles, propelling your movements in an elegant, almost absurdly choreographed dance.

The Hunter roars, its infinite form twisting to follow your motion, its shadow consuming the space in its wake. “You think you can outrun me? Balance is not something you can flee from!”

But your steps—those unreasonably graceful, unpracticed pirouettes—only seem to grow more fluid. The world bends to your defiance, ice glimmering into existence beneath each stride, accompanied by the faint hum of what can only be described as a celestial Zamboni trailing behind.

“Where did he get skates?!” Wonky yells, his voice cracking under the strain of the moment.

Aurion is less amused, still holding off the Hunter with every ounce of their strength. “I don’t know! I don’t care! Just go, Trenton! Whatever you’re doing, make it count!”

And you do. With one final flourish, you leap—not from fear, but from the sudden clarity of the Unnamed Feeling coursing through you. In that moment, you’re not running away; you’re skating toward the culmination of everything.

The Zamboni’s ethereal hum crescendos, its shimmering wheels carving a perfect circle in the void. The Hunter halts, momentarily thrown by the absurdity. And there, in the center of the unholy rink, you land—gliding effortlessly toward an invisible goal.

With a triumphant cry, you extend an arm. Somehow, inexplicably, the essence of the W0nn0ng G0aL manifests in your grasp—a blazing, amorphous puck of light and shadow. You aim, you shoot.

It connects.

The void trembles. The Hunter recoils, its infinite form scattering like ash in the wind. The balance shifts, teetering on the edge of something...new.

Aurion collapses to their knees, staring at the aftermath. “Did he just...win?”

Wonky, pale and shaking, whispers, “I think he scored...the W0nn0ng G0aL.”

You stand there, victorious and bewildered, the ice beneath your feet melting into nothingness. The Unnamed Feeling hums within you, quiet and resolute. You’ve done it.

...Whatever it was.

The silence settles again, heavy and surreal.

Aurion looks at you, their blade still glowing faintly in the fading light of the void. “So… that just happened.” Their voice is flat, teetering on disbelief.

Wonky stumbles forward, clutching the remnants of his vial. "I… I don’t know if that was genius or insanity. Probably both?"

You stare at your hands, still tingling with the afterglow of the W0nn0ng G0aL. "Yeah… uh… I meant to do that," you mumble, though even you aren’t entirely sure how you pulled it off—or why the cosmic Zamboni had to be part of the process.

The void around you shifts, as if watching, waiting. The Hunter’s voice echoes faintly, a shadow of its former self. “This… is not over. Balance will… find you again.”

Aurion groans. “Yeah, great. Can it wait a minute? I think I sprained my everything.”

Wonky edges closer, looking both nervous and oddly impressed. “So… Trenton… What now? You… uh, kinda broke the rules of reality there. Are we… safe? Is anything safe?”

You take a deep breath, still processing the chaos, the victory, and the utter ridiculousness of what just unfolded. The Unnamed Feeling hums faintly within you, not as a guide, but as a quiet reminder.

"Well," you say, shrugging, "if balance wants me, it’s gonna have to learn how to ice skate."

Aurion and Wonky exchange a glance, and then—against all odds—burst out laughing. It’s the kind of laugh that’s half relief, half exhaustion, and entirely unhinged.

The void, for once, remains silent.
