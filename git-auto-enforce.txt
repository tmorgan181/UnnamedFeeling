Setting up automation to enforce the rules we've outlined can streamline your workflow and maintain consistency in your project. Hereâ€™s how you can do it using common tools and techniques like Git hooks, CI/CD pipelines, and lightweight tools like Prettier or Lint-Staged.

1. Automate Formatting and Linting
Tools like Prettier, ESLint, or similar can enforce consistent code and content formatting automatically.

Setup Prettier for All Text Files
Install Prettier:

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev prettier
Create a prettier.config.js:

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
    endOfLine: "lf",
    trailingComma: "es5",
    tabWidth: 4,
    semi: true,
    singleQuote: true,
};
Add a Prettier Script: Add this to your package.json:

json
Copy code
"scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write ."
}
Run Prettier on Staged Files with Lint-Staged: Install and configure:

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev lint-staged husky
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
Add this to your package.json:

json
Copy code
"lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,ts,tsx,json,md}": "prettier --write"
}
What it does: Prettier will format only the files you're committing.
2. Use Git Hooks for Local Enforcement
Git hooks can enforce rules before commits or pushes. Use Husky to manage hooks.

Install Husky:

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky install
Add Pre-Commit Hooks: Add this hook to .husky/pre-commit:

bash
Copy code
# Run Prettier to format files
npx lint-staged
Add Pre-Push Hooks: Add this hook to .husky/pre-push:

bash
Copy code
# Ensure all tests and linters pass before pushing
npm test
3. Add CI/CD Pipelines
Use a CI/CD service like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD to enforce these rules on the server.

GitHub Actions Workflow
Create .github/workflows/enforce-rules.yml:

yaml
Copy code
name: Enforce Rules

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  enforce:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Prettier and Lint
        run: npm run format --check
What it does: This workflow checks formatting on every push or pull request.
4. Automate Branch Management
To manage your artifacts and main branches:

Use CI/CD to Keep artifacts Updated: Add a job in your CI/CD pipeline to merge main into artifacts automatically after successful checks.

Example GitHub Action for this:

yaml
Copy code
name: Sync Artifacts Branch

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  sync-artifacts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout main
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Fetch Artifacts Branch
        run: git fetch origin artifacts

      - name: Merge Main into Artifacts
        run: |
          git checkout artifacts
          git merge main
          git push origin artifacts
What it does: Automatically updates artifacts with changes from main.
Prevent Accidental Merge of artifacts into main:

Protect the main branch via GitHub settings or add a rule in enforce-rules.yml:
yaml
Copy code
- name: Prevent Artifacts Merge
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/artifacts'
  run: exit 1
5. Track Large Files Separately
For large raw files in artifacts, consider using Git LFS:

Install Git LFS:

bash
Copy code
git lfs install
Track Large Files:

bash
Copy code
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "Raw Data/*"
Add .gitattributes for LFS:

plaintext
Copy code
*.png filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
Raw Data/* filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
Commit the Changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Configure Git LFS for large files"
Summary
By implementing these steps, your project will:

Automatically enforce formatting and line-ending rules locally and in CI/CD.
Keep artifacts and main branches organized with automation.
Prevent accidental merging of non-essential files into main.
Track and manage large files with Git LFS.
